This dataset is a hand noted dataset that consists of two categories, evasion and normal methods. By evasion methods we mean the methods that are used by Android malware to hide their malicious payload, and hinder the dynamic analysis. Normal methods are any other methods that cannot be used as evasion techniques. Also, the evasion methods are categorized into six categories: File access, Integrity check, Location, SMS, Time, Anti-emulation. This dataset can be used by any ML or DL approaches to predict new evasion techniques that can be used by malware to hinder the dynamic analysis.
